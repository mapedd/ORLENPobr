ORLENPobr for iOS

This project was made for faculty project at my university (Warsaw University of Technology, Politechnika Warszawska). 
Course name was Image Computing (Przetwarzanie Obraz√≥w - POBR).

Subject was to recognise the logo of polish company Orlen.

App can take a picture from library or capture it from camera. 

It's version which i've showed to a teacher, it's not very complete, but works.

Interesting fact is it implements Flood Fill algorithm, it was rewritten for iOS from OSX version of "Paintbrush"
